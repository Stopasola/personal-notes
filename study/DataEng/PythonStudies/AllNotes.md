## Python - [List Comprehension](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp)

List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

``` newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True] ```

- Expression: is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list

``` newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits] ```
